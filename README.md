1. First name (string)
1. Last name (string)
1. Age (integer)
1. Cohort number (integer)
1. Full name (read-only string)
- Define getters for all properties.
- Define a setter for all but the read only property.
- Ensure that only the appropriate value can be assigned to each.
- The full name property should return first name and last name separated by a space. It's value cannot be set.
